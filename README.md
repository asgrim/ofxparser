OFX Parser
=================

OFX Parser is a PHP library designed to parse an OFX file downloaded from a financial institution into simple PHP objects.

It supports multiple Bank Accounts, the required "Sign On" response, and recognises OFX timestamps.


##Installation

Simply require this package in your composer.json:

```js
{
    "require": {
        "asgrim/ofxparser": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then update composer:

```bash
$ php composer.phar update asgrim/ofxparser
```

## Usage
You can access the nodes in your OFX file as follows:

```php
$OfxParser = new \OfxParser\Parser;
$Ofx = $OfxParser->loadFromFile('/path/to/your/bankstatement.ofx');

// Get the statement start and end dates
$startDate = $Ofx->BankAccount->Statement->startDate;
$endDate = $Ofx->BankAccount->Statement->endDate;

// Get the statements for the current bank account
$transactions = $Ofx->BankAccount->Statement->transactions;
```

Most common nodes are support. If you come across an inaccessible node in your OFX file, please submit a pull request!


## Fork & Credits
This is a fork of [grimfor/ofxparser](https://github.com/Grimfor/ofxparser) made to be framework independent. The source repo was designed for Symfony 2 framework, so credit should be given where credit due!
Heavily refactored by [Oliver Lowe](https://github.com/loweoj) and loosely based on the ruby [ofx-parser by Andrew A. Smith](https://github.com/aasmith/ofx-parser).
